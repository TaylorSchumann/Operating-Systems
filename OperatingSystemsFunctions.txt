The first function would be turning on your phone. That is really step one for your operating system. To turn on your system you need to press the power button, which is located on your systems unit, side or top of phone or inside your laptop. Once the device is on it will run a series of test to make sure eveything checks out before taking you to the home screen.
File manager is a great function. This function keeps track of your information, also know as the "file system." It deals with renaming, moving, copying or deleting.
